# LorenzChaosEncryption

This is an image encryption script in Python written for our first semester's month-long project for the course Ordinary Differential Equations at DUCIC. This code was written by a team of four members and includes three sample images to try and test upon. 

The shuffling and substitution algorithms have been used. The Lorenz system of ordinary linear differential equations (which is a chaotic system for specific values of its parameters) was used as a PRNG.
